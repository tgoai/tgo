# Introduction to TGO

**TGO** is an open-source AI agent customer service platform. We are dedicated to helping enterprises build smarter and more efficient customer service systems through the **Multi-Agents** collaboration model.

Unlike traditional chatbots, TGO emphasizes collaboration between agents. You can assemble a team composed of agents with different capabilities to collaboratively handle complex customer inquiries, after-sales support, and business lead generation.

## Key Highlights

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Flexibly create and orchestrate multiple AI agents, allowing them to perform their respective duties and work together.
- 📚 **Knowledge Base Enhancement (RAG)**: Built-in high-performance RAG system supporting PDF, Docx uploads, web crawling, etc., making AI understand your business.
- 🛠️ **MCP Tool Extension**: Supports Model Context Protocol, easily connecting to external APIs, databases, and business tools.
- 🌐 **Omnichannel Access**: One system supporting Web, API, WeChat, Lark, DingTalk, and other mainstream channels.
- 🤝 **Human-AI Collaboration**: Agents handle repetitive inquiries and seamlessly transfer to human agents at critical moments to improve customer satisfaction.

## Technical Architecture

TGO adopts a modern microservices architecture to ensure system stability and scalability.
